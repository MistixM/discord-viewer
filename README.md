A simple discord bot that demonstrates power of Discord API. In this project I used Humor API for jokes and Discord API for basic bot behaviour.

1. Download and unpack .zip file with project.
2. Install Python if it doesn't exist
3. Run following command to install all required libraries

```

4. After installation open `config.ini` to setup Discord, Humor API's and set the discord server ID
5. Run `python main.py` to start the bot
